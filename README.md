# INF2004-Embedded-Micro-mouse

Develop a robot car that navigates a _predefined track_, _efficiently avoiding obstacles_ and _recognizing barcodes_ using infrared sensors. The integration of
a _PID controller_ enhances the car's control system, ensuring smooth and accurate motion during navigation and _barcode scanning_.
